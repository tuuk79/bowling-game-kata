Uncle Bob’s Bowling Game Kata
Sharpening some Java skills.

A game of tenpins bowling lasts ten frames, in each of which the bowler makes one or two attempts to knock down ten pins arranged in a triangle. If the bowler knocks down all ten pins on the first attempt (that’s called a “strike”), he scores ten pins plus the number of pins knocked down on his next two rolls.

If the bowler knocks down all ten pins after two attempts (that’s called a “spare”), he scores ten pins plus the number of pins knocked down on his next roll. If the bowler fails to knock down all ten pins (that’s called an “open frame”), he scores the number of pins he knocked down. The scores accumulate through all ten frames. At the last frame, if necessary, the pins are reset for one or two additional rolls to count the final bonus.

Your task is to write a function that calculates the score of a tenpins bowling game.
